These executables are UNIX only and will not work on any other OS.

These do not run standalone, and the only way I have currently found to run them is to run
them by invoking in a shell or terminal. Make sure you have execute permissions by:

chmod +x /path/to/file

and then invoke it by doing:

./solitaireClient____

of course replace ____ with the version you want, local or global.
